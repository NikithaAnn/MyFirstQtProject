## Description
The name "boid" corresponds to a shortened version of "bird-oid object", which refers to a bird-like object. Boids is an artificial life program, developed by Craig Reynolds in 1986, which simulates the flocking behaviour of birds.

This project creates a simple Boid shaped VertexArrayObject. The normals are calculated and added to the VAO as well. This was developed to get accustomed to using Qtcreator and C++ with OpenGL shaders.
